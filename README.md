## OVERVIEW:

This program simulates a piece of cloth made from particles, spring-dampers, and triangular surfaces. It should include the effects of uniform gravity, spring elasticity, damping, aerodynamic drag, and simple ground plane collisions. Some particles of the cloth must be ‘fixed’ in place in order to hold the cloth up, and there must be simple controls to move these fixed points around, as well as controls to adjust the ambient wind speed.

## PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:

- Basic cloth physics with Newtonian particles, gravity, and spring-dampers
- Aerodynamic interactions & adjustable wind speed
- Ground plane collision handling
- Fixed particles and effective user manipulation
